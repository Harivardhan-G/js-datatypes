DOM (document object model):
It is a programming interface in web development that allows us to interact  and manipulate  the html documents.
When the web page is loaded , the browser creates the DOM of the webpage.
When an html file is loaded into the browser , the javascript cannot understand the html document directly
DOM: is basically the representation of same html document but in a tree like a structure composed of objects.
HTML DOM allows javascript to access (to get) and modify all elements in the HTML document 

Key points:
